### General Info
 This project is basically the mini version of the well known app **Instagram**. It has some of the features of instagram like signin, signup, uploading images, like and dislike feature for images and sharing feature by which the user can share his image to anyone with the help of a link.

### Purpose of Project
 As it is my first project, the main motive is to learn web development and also to be the part of the club **Cyberlabs** so that I can work better on my skills under the guidance of seniors.

### Teck Stack
* For the frontend purpose, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap are used for creating a user friendly website.
* For the backend and functioning of website, Javascript and Firebase are used.
* Firebase Auth is used for user authentication.
* Firestore Database is used for the storage of data of the user.

### How to Use
* Index.html is the first page of the website, from here one can find signin form.
* On the first page if the person is already a member then he can signin with email and password. But if he is new to this website then 
  he have to signup first as directed on the page.
* After successfully signing in the user is redirected to it's profile page, where it can upload it's images and can like and dislike 
  the images. The images can also be shared by copying the link by clicking on the share button of the respective image which is to be
  shared.
* The shared image can be opened by pasting the shared link in the browser and can be liked directly if the user already signedin in 
  that browser. If the user is not signed in then on clicking like button it have to sign in first and then can like the image.
* To like the shared image, the person must have already signup to the website.
